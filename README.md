# MatchTope
MatchTope is a tool developed for predicting peptide similarity, which can trigger cross-reactivity events by computing and analyzing the electrostatic potentials of pMHC complexes. MatchTope uses a modified version of the PIPSA tool. The PIPSA standalone can be obtained at http://pipsa.h-its.org.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.7 version or higher
- R version 3.6.3 or higher
- pvclust (R package) version 2.2-0 or higher (apt install r-cran-pvclust)
- Pymol version 2.5.2 or higher (It can be installed with conda: conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source)
- Modeled pMHC or crystal files

# How to run:
- Put your pdb files into the PDBs folder. It already has three files that can be used to test the tool.
- In your terminal, run 'bash run_pipsa.sh'.
- When it finishes, it will generate a pdf file called Results.pdf in the same folder of run_pipsa.sh.
- There is a file called 'Results_example.pdf'. It is an output from the three PDBs examples in the PDBs folder.

## Running MatchTope with Docker

MatchTope can be easily run in a Docker container, which encapsulates all its dependencies and provides a consistent running environment. This section guides you through the process of using Docker to run MatchTope.

### Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop (for Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (for Linux)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

First, clone the MatchTope repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcus-Mendes/MatchTope.git
cd MatchTope
```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

In the root directory of the project, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t matchtope .
```

This command reads the Dockerfile in the current directory and builds an image named "matchtope".

2.1 **Windons OS**

Install Docker Desktop on Windows: If you haven't already, download and install Docker Desktop for Windows from the official Docker website.

* Enable WSL 2 Integration in Docker Desktop:
  * Open Docker Desktop.
  * Go to Settings (the gear icon).
  * Click on Resources > WSL Integration.
  * Enable integration with your WSL 2 distro (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).
  
  * Apply & Restart Docker Desktop.
        
    Restart WSL 2: Sometimes, a restart of the WSL 2 instance is required for changes to take effect. 

    You can restart WSL 2 by running the following command in your Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell:

    ```bash
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

  Then, reopen your WSL 2 Ubuntu terminal.
  


* Verify Docker Installation:

After the restart, in your WSL 2 Ubuntu terminal, check if Docker is accessible by running:

```bash
docker --version
```
You should see the Docker version if it's installed correctly.

2.2 **Add your user to the docker**
You must add your user to the docker group so that you can execute Docker commands without needing sudo. Here's how to do it:

Add Your User to the Docker Group:
Open your WSL 2 terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Apply the Group Changes:
For the group change to take effect, you need to log out and log back into your session. An easy way to do this in WSL 2 is to close the WSL 2 terminal, then reopen it.

Look for docker in the output list.

This process alloud to run Docker Commands Without sudo:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash matchtope
```

Verify the Changes:
After reopening your WSL 2 terminal, you can check if your user has been added to the docker group or you are the root user in the env by running:

```bash
groups
```

By enabling WSL 2 integration in Docker Desktop and ensuring Docker commands are accessible within your WSL 2 Ubuntu distro, you should be able to build Docker images directly from WSL 2.

1. **Prepare Input Data:**

Place your PDB files into the PDBs folder. If this folder does not exist, create it in the root directory of the project.

4. **Run the Docker Container:**

Execute the following command to run MatchTope inside the matchtope_env from the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash matchtope
```

This command mounts the PDBs folder from your local machine to the container and sets up a Results folder for the output.

5. **Accessing Results:**

After the container finishes running, the output (e.g., Results.pdf) will be available in the Results folder on your local machine.

**Note for Linux Users:**

Replace `${PWD}` with `$PWD` in the Docker run command to reference the current directory.
